# generic-chip8-interpreter
A generic chip8 interpreter I created as an entry level project into writing emulators

Doesn't have sound yet, probably never will unless I get off my lazy ass and do it

# Usage
To compile, you will need SDL2.

To run: `chip8 <rom file>`

Keyboard layout:
```
1 2 3 4
q w e r
a s d f
z x c v
```

# bruh
A bunch of roms can be found here: https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms
